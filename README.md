_Password Generator._


Hello! My name is Mike. I am a dreamer, designer, and developer. Welcome to my password generator!

I created the password generator by writing the Javascript from scratch, which I linked to a pre-built html & css. It was a fantastic challenge that pushed me to the limits, trying to implement my newly learned hand at writing Javascript. I was able to create a working password generator by breaking it down, step by step, using the following methods: The first thing I accomplished was linking my javascript file to html, I then created variables for all of the possible password characters, the next step was to make a function and alert to let the user input a password character length of 8-128 characters, I then created confirm alerts so the user could select what type of characters they wanted, next I created an empty array which I fed with the selected possible characters, then I created a loop that assisted in selecting random characters at appropriate lengths, next I wrote the generated password to the html, and lastly I added an Event Listener so that the operation would run once the user clicked the Generate Password Button. Overall, it was a very challenging and logically intensive project; at the same time, it was quite rewarding to learn, grow, and accomplish the mission of creating a working password generator! 

Thanks for stopping in! I look forward to working together to make the present and future a better place.
